        <h1>About Ways Unseen</h1>
          <p>I&apos;m an illustrator and cartographer of sorts, living in the east of England in a county
          called Norfolk. I&apos;ve always enjoyed drawing, though for much of my life, I have shied away
          from actually putting pencil to paper. Now that I&apos;ve started in earnest, I never want 
          to stop!</p>

          <p>I started out drawing top-down maps when I discovered solo tabletop gaming (games like Four
          Against Darkness) and, instead of sketching out purely functional outlines, I found myself
          compelled to take my time and make my maps beautiful.</p>

          <p>In the years since, I&apos;ve been creating and sharing maps in an increasingly broad range of
            styles. After starting with traditional top-down style maps, I progressed onto more
            challenging isometric locations. These proved quite popular and saw my social media 
            following grow quickly.
          </p>

          <p>This increased exposure lead to commission requests and I&apos;ve now worked with a number of
            game designers to produce high-quality hand-drawn maps to help realise their creations. As
            time has gone on, I&apos;ve broadened the range of map styles, including region and town maps, hex-maps
            and cut away maps, each enabling me to represent locations in different ways.
          </p>

          <p>Thanks for showing an interest in my work. (Add some contact info and links to other
            sections of the site.
